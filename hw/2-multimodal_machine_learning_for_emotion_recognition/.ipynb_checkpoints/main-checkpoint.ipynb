    "In the file dataset.csv, you are provided with the relative address for the audio, visual and text feature files alongwith their corresponding emotion labels. There are 5 sessions and each session has one male and one female speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use different pooling methods (e.g., max pooling, mean pooling) for reducing the temporal dimensionof the audio and visual files, or use your preferred temporal modeling (e.g., RNN, GRU, LSTM) to obtainfeature vectors per data point.1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform a 4-class emotion classification using your preferred classifier with the obtained feature vectors. Selectthe parameters using Grid Search (search over a range for hyper-parameters). Perform any additional stepsyou see fit to obtain the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Report your classification results on individual modalities (vision, speech, and text) using F1-micro metricon a 10-fold subject-independent cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do you handle the problem of class imbalance? Plot the confusion matrix for the 4 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use both early fusion (concatenate features from different modalities) and late fusion (majority vote over theoutputs of the unimodal models) to obtain multimodal classification results. Report and compare the resultsfor both fusion techniques.\n",

    "6. Provide an interpretation on your results from the performed unimodal and multimodal classification tasks.Which one is performing best and why?\n",
