# Within this notebook, you can find 
1. Imports + Load Data
2. Fleiss' kappa calculations
3. My Annotations of Y and N
4. Student T-Test calculations
5. Summary of my work

# Running this notebook
- You can "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..." which will show the outputs for the above tasks. 
- For task 1, you will find "test_..." variables. You can ignore those as I created a sample set to manually ensure the correctness of my Fleiss' kappa calculations. 
- For task 3, I'm using r and the library called rpy2 to communicate my r script with python. Within the notebook, r is referencing the "ttest.r" script to calculate the Student t-test. 
- You can also navigate to the datasets/ipd_data/ to see the datasets
