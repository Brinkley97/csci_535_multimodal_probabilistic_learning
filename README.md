1. Annotation aggregation and exploratory analysis. Navigate to [my code](https://github.com/Brinkley97/csci_535_multimodal_probabilistic_learning/blob/main/hw/1-annotation_aggregation_and_exploratory_analysis/main.ipynb) or see [my thoughts and process](https://detraviousjbrinkley.notion.site/HW-1-Annotation-aggregation-and-exploratory-analysis-Due-e60bdf637f5b40d98c296a7280e1b520)

   - Inter-rater agreement (IRA) is understanding how much labelers/annotates agree (on certain emotions). In order to understand this agreement, you can compute Cohen’s kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha, etc. We calculated Fleiss’ Kappa.
   - After that, we annotated 20 videos WRT 2 cues (joy and surprise). By this, we stated if a particular video expressed joy (N or Y) or surprise (N or Y). We then performed a Students T-test to understand the significance of our votings.

## Play

- See play folder
- Models and algorithms I come across WRT to this course

## Open Source models

- Will only provide models and reasonings for using models. Will not include their code as you can navigate to their page to pull the base code.
