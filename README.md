1. Annotation aggregation and exploratory analysis. See [more details]() 

   - Inter-rater agreement (IRA) is understanding how much labelers/annotates agree (on certain emotions). In order to understand this agreement, you can compute Cohen’s kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha, etc. We calculated Fleiss’ Kappa. 
   - After that, we annotated 20 videos WRT 2 cues (joy and surprise). By this, we stated if a particular video expressed joy (N or Y) or surprise (N or Y). We then performed a Students T-test to understand the significance of our votings.
