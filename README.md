1. Annotation aggregation and exploratory analysis
   - About : In this exercise, we become acquainted with some methods for gathering and analyzing annotations. We will alsolearn about inter-annotation agreement which permits assessing the reliability of our ratings, along with exploratoryanalysis of the data.
   - Dataset : **IPD dataset** consists of nonverbal clips of peoplereacting to the result of a game they are playing with their partner. The subset you will be working with includes100 videos that were given emotion labels by 100 crowd workers. Each crowd worker rated a random sample of 20videos, resulting in each video having 20 ratings. You can read more about the dataset in Section 2 of the paperhere2, but it is not required for this assignment. The video IDs and ratings are saved in tabulatedVotes.csv. Inthis file, for each video, you can find the number of votes for each of the 7 categories of emotions (Anger, Disgust,Fear, Joy, Neutral, Sadness and Surprise).
